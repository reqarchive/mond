      <p>will riiz3 be called gay4pay queerbaiters whose music isn&#x27;t selling (which would
actually add up considering their recent charting in comparison to their older
songs and how they&#x27;ve never done shit like this before) bc of these new concert
clips i&#x27;ve been seeing or is that just reserved for zbwon who don&#x27;t even do all
that (but i saw someone call them that bc of that stupid aboutmusic tweet about
gw fainting in the sauna and aboutmusic specifying that they would&#x27;ve been naked
ðŸ™„)</p>
