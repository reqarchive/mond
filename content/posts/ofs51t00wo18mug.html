      <p>This further making me think something fishy went on behind the scenes and those
tour dates were donâ€™t to mess things up for them as much as possible because
their ainâ€™t no way a whole organisation out there liking fan tweets that they
werenâ€™t even tagged in shading wk1 ðŸ˜­</p>

      <p>I agree w u like I hate wkn but people are always mistaking their incompetency
for actual maliciousness. I mean theyâ€™re def sabotaging the group w how theyâ€™ve
left them to rot for months but again that comes down to poor planning and
execution (and bp 2 airing doesnâ€™t help us either). saying theyâ€™re restricting
hb on purpose is the same line of thinking as believing certain members are
banned. I imagine when the organizers reached out wkn already knew theyâ€™d be
touring and figured it was easier to say no than to try and organize around it.
theyâ€™re lazy and disorganized but theyâ€™re not the evil masterminds people think
they are</p>
