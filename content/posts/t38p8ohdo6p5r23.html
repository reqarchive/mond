      <p>One of my old oomfs who would communicate with kyla through that gc told me she
was actually a vibe and would always give them tea on calls and stuff. I kinda
feel bad for her because she had a lot of insecurities. She debuted around the
time where two other wasian idols were at there peak in popularity (Somi and
Nancy) yet the wasians hype didnâ€™t translate to her</p>
