      <p>Iâ€™m 2 biased but he just pissed me off with that debut vlog. He didnâ€™t have a
single jb1 member in it but fucking bn/d gets to be in it? A DEBUT ANNIVERSARY
VLOG? Iâ€™m so mad at him rn. Seeing their faces makes me wanna throw up</p>

      <p>i like hb as a leader but he has a people pleasing problem (people =
schizallins) he seems scared of their reaction to anything he does and he cares
too much about not pissing them off even if it means cutting down on
interactions with his members</p>

      <p>i might be wrong but the day he filmed his vlog, zgh was in italy, gyu was still
in jp so maybe they didn&#x27;t have any group practice and that&#x27;s why there was no
group shot and maybe mtw was also still in canada, everyone was just doing their
own things</p>
