      <p>okay see i was getting what anon was saying bc that bizness song is something
else but then them saying wumut1 and ru1 look tan like whatâ€¦â€¦.? if anything
whenever i see wumut1 i think he looks like a sickly victorian child bc of how
pale he is now when in older pics and videos, even in bopeul era, he has a
slight tan. like this guy is uyghur chinese in case everyone forgot and yet he
looks like THAT now like it has to be some sort of whitening powder or cream ðŸ’€</p>
