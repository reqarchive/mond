Iâ€™m already seeing it rn that this is gonna be the reason sangwon either ends up
not debuting/leaves the show while itâ€™s still going on/or leaves the group all
together right after getting voted in because he only wants to debut with Leo so
badly (heâ€™s going even harder for Leo than Leo his for him and itâ€™s actually
embarrassing) like bruh yk your kfans donâ€™t fw leo and yet still come out to
fansites with matching hats, necklaces and outfits ðŸ˜­</p>
