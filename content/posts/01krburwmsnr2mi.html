      <p>i was wondering why there&#x27;s no anniv vlog uploaded today and then i saw b2p
teaser on my timeline and it clicked i guess it&#x27;s true that all the plans for
jebe1 this year got postponed bc of b2p ðŸ’€ i mean we know they purposely messed
up jebew&#x27;s schedules and stuff to make the fans move to b2p but damn even our
anniv content too?</p>
