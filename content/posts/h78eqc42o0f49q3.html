      <p>Remember when gwk told his story about how he choose his rm01 song? He said &quot;I
was contemplating which song should I choose. The one I want to do or the one
that will gain me views. In the end I choose to do what I want!&quot;



Darling that&#x27;s not how idol world works, even random streamer on onlifans would
make a better idol choice than you atp ðŸ¤¨</p>

      <p>this reminds me of tr doing the same old boring ballads that nobodyâ€™s ever heard
of during his lee mujin video like i didnâ€™t expect a setlist full of really
popular dance songs but like ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ heâ€™s the least popular member of the group
BUT he is one of two main vocalists and thatâ€™s what everyone knows about him so
it couldâ€™ve drawn ppl in (the squid game one kinda did but THAT WAS IT) but then
he decided to do THOSE songs that no one cares for? that really pissed me off
like damn are him and gw preparing for their post-zbwon nugudom or something ðŸ˜­</p>
