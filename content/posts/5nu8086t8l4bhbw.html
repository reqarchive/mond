      <p>it depends what u consider content tbh because if it&#x27;s official schedules sure
(2 this year + tingle) but if its tiktoks/vlogs/whatever it&#x27;s probably mttbn or
mttprkz?</p>

      <p>Well I mean anon thatâ€™s just shows how they arenâ€™t banned because why would wki
let them go on yt shows and contents and promote themselves officially as a duo
but stop them from doing silly little tiktoks on the groups account ðŸ˜­ its more
likely the case if they just post with whoever they want or talk to about
specific challanges</p>

      <p>ah yea this wasn&#x27;t about the &quot;ban&quot; at all lol the convo here was just duos who
have the most content as a whole after 2bnz



and i agree, i do think there&#x27;s something weird around them and i can admit wk1
has been weird about them too, but imo it can be easily explained whether u
think they&#x27;re in a rs or not (be it because of shippers or akgaes or just
enjoying their time privately or whatever) and not a straight up &quot;ban&quot; lol



the only time i recall them straight up acknowledging something was implying
they couldn&#x27;t do a live together which i will admit was weird (them even being
roommates and saying they were originally going to do one and we got 2bnz
instead lmao + hb implying they couldn&#x27;t at a fansign too)</p>
