      <p>Oh yall gonna be realll sad when I tell you this but during in bloom era he said
his next ideal hairstyle was dreadlocks (he said like cause one of his old
american friends who Iâ€™m guessing was black had it or something like that canâ€™t
remember itâ€™s been 2 years so hopefully heâ€™s changed his mind) Only a few
r1y@ng!z knew about it cause it was a post and delete but the ones who knew kept
it on a dl.

deleted account)
