      <p>he went to their cruise thing last year and was still not made an ambassador
iirc plus his fans were even saying finally and stuff when it was announced
becuz at some point it seemed like gucci were never going to sign him and it was
going nowhere between them but also this may mean nothing because it’s prob diff
branches of gucci handling this stuff? also idk if this is true but someone said
u need a personal ig to become a solo luxury brand ambassador?</p>
