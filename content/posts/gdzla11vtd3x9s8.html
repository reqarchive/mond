      <p>so i think i saw some talks on the tl but i think there was some kinda chn
entertainment ban (similar to things that happen before) where it&#x27;s like some
kinda commemorative day or something so i think that&#x27;s why there wasn&#x27;t really
any entertainment/news content posted....also why zh didn&#x27;t come on plus chat at
all yesterday but did this morning (i don&#x27;t count rk lol)</p>
